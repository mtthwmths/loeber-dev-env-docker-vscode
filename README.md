# Summary

This repo was created while following along with [How to create a great dev environment with Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H2miBK_gAk) by [Patrick Loeber](youtube.com/@patloeber)

I've tried to update the container in place and avoid using root user to run tasks like you would do in a production environment, but I'm sure this is all terrible and there are much better ways to accomplish.

Learned a bit about Docker, Docker-Compose, VS Code Dev Containers, Python Virtual Environment, Uvicorn, FastAPI, etc.

Hopefully this helps someone struggling with the same video.
